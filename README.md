**Objective**: The objective is to build an ideal ML algorithm that will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like promotions, state and school holidays.

**Business Context**:
- One of the leading retail stores in US, ABC would like to predict the customers and demand accurately.
- There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. The company runs several promotional markdown events throughout each year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays such as super bowl, labor day, thanksgiving and christmas.
- Main part of the use-case is to model the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in absence of the complete historical data.
